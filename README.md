## 🛠️ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash

```

### 2. Configure Environment
Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-connection-string

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3012
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

Generate a secure secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Seed Database
```bash
npm run seed
```

This creates three demo accounts:
- **Admin:** admin@loanaticks.com / admin123

npm run dev
# or specify a port
PORT=3012 npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3012

The login page now features **instant one-click login buttons**:

- **Purple Button** → Admin Login
- **Blue Button** → Employee Login  
- **Green Button** → Customer Login

Just click any button to instantly log in as that user type - no need to type credentials!
